# Recipe App

Recipe App lets you add recipes to your recipebook (maybe by category)
and create a Pantry of the current stock of ingredients you have.
You can mark recipes as "want to make" and receive a shopping list of
items needed based off of your pantry. You can then mark recipes as "post-shop"
to update your Pantry and even mark them as "made" to update your pantry stock (maybe have
some indicator when submitting that maybe you used more than an ingredient to update it before submitting).

Will have a list of defined ingredients/quantities/measurement-units users can select when adding recipes and if it doesn't
exist they can create their own igredient item for their recipe (possible problems with stocking pantry if item name varies from already
tracked item)
