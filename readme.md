    buttery lets you add your own recipes and create a virtual pantry to keep
    track of your pantry's ingredients. You can add recipes you want to make to
    your cooking list and receive a shopping list of items needed based off of
    your pantry stock. You can mark a recip as "shop" to add missing
    ingredients to a shopping list or, if you have the required ingredients,
    mark a recipe as 'cooked' to deduct the ingredients from your pantry.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Shopping List

A user can generate a shopping list based on recieps they add as "want to make". The app knows what ingredients aren't in the pantry or if making a recipe will cause you to run out of an ingredient, so you should buy more. In your shopping list you can click "shopped" to update your pantry with the items that were in your shopping list.

### Pantry

Ingredients can be added to a 'virtual pantry' by using a dynamic form on the "/pantry" page. This allows the app to dynamically update the pantry based on what ingredients are used for any given recipe that you mark as "made". Your pantry is also what allows the app to know how close you are to being able to make a recipe.
***Current Limitations***
Only ingredients in both your pantry and a recipe  matching the same measurement unit will be used to track how close a recipe is to being able to be made. Plans are in the works to convert different units of measurement to allow more dynamic ingredient calculations.

### Recipes

Recipes can be added from scratch using a dynamic form on the "/recipes" page. This allows you to keep track of any recipes you want to add and allows the app to know what ingredients are needed and can compare them with what is in your pantry.

There will be a colored number indicator (I call this the recipe distance) on a recipe for how close a recipe is to being able to be made for a quick visual cue as to what recipes can be made. On the homepage, the recipes will be sorted in ascending order based on the recipe distance.

When viewing a recipe, the ingredients are highlighted to let a user know if they will run out of an ingredient if they make the recipe or making the recipe will cause them to run out so they should buy more. Conveniently, there is a button to add a recipes missing ingredients to the shopping list.
